## How It Operates 

The webapp works in two different ways depending if you are user or a admin :

1. **User Side:** The user has the control over the website front end and it's functionalities. 

2. **Admin Side:** The Admin side has a **Login ID** and **PWD** with which they can access the admin side of the website.
